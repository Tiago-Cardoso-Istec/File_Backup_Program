How to start the File Sync Program (main.py)(in windows):

1. Open the command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where main.py is located using the 'cd' command
	
	example:
	cd path\to\script\directory

3. Execute the script using the 'python' command and provide the required command-line arguments
   -source_path: The path to the source folder you want to synchronize.
   -replica_path: The path to the replica folder where you want to create a copy of the source folder.
   -sync_interval: The synchronization interval in seconds. The script will periodically synchronize the folders based on this interval.
   -log_file: The path to the log file where synchronization and logging information will be recorded.
	
	example
	python main.py /path/to/source /path/to/replica 3600 /path/to/logfile.log

4. Once you run the script, it will start synchronizing the source and replica folders at the specified interval.
   You will see log messages both in the console and in the specified log file.

5. You can terminate the script at any time by pressing 'Ctrl' + 'C' in the command prompt.
